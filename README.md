# Deep Belief Networks - Internal representation and Adversarial Attacks

Exploration of how a DBN learns some high-level features of the data. The models are implemented in MATLAB and data are represented by dendrograms and scatterplots, produced by using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding technique. The simulation involves data augmentation and adversarial attacks to test the robustness of the models.
