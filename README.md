# Deep Belief Networks - Internal representation and Adversarial Attacks

Exploration of how a DBN learns some high-level features of the data. The models are implemented in MATLAB and data are represented by dendrograms and scatterplots, produced by using the t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding technique (the code is in the python notebook). The simulation involves data augmentation and adversarial attacks to test the robustness of the models.

Each .mat file refers to a different dataset: EMNIST Digits, EMNIST Letters, EMNIST Digits with noise and data augmentation, EMNIST Digits with Adversarial examples.
